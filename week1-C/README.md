# CS50x – Week 1: C

This folder contains my work for **Week 1 of CS50x**, where the course transitions
from Scratch to **C programming**.

Week 1 focuses on understanding how low-level programs work and how high-level
ideas like loops and conditionals translate into C.

## 🧠 Concepts Learned

During this week, I learned and practiced:

- Source code vs machine code
- Compilation using `make`
- Writing and running C programs
- Data types (`int`, `long`, `char`, `float`, `bool`)
- Format specifiers (`%i`, `%li`, `%f`, `%s`)
- Conditionals (`if`, `else if`, `else`)
- Loops (`while`, `for`, `do–while`)
- Functions and abstraction
- Variable scope
- Integer overflow and type limits
- Casting and integer vs floating-point division

## 🛠️ Programs Implemented

### Basic Programs
- `hello.c` – First C program
- `compare.c` – Comparing integers using conditionals
- `agree.c` – Character input and logical operators
- `calculator.c` – Arithmetic operations and type behavior

These programs helped build familiarity with C syntax and control flow.

## 🍄 Mario Problem

The **Mario (more)** problem was the main challenge of Week 1.

It required:
- Nested loops
- Input validation
- Careful handling of spaces and alignment
- Breaking the problem into smaller parts

I solved it iteratively and documented my final approach inside:
