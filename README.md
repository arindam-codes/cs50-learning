# CS50 Week 7 – Data & CSV Learning Log

This repository documents how I studied CS50 Week 7
(Data, CSV, DictReader, sorting, generators) entirely
through terminal-based experimentation.

## What this repo contains

- `terminal_practice`
  - Raw terminal experiments
  - Mistakes I made
  - Observations and fixes

- `csv_experiments`
  - Python scripts used to test concepts
  - Frequency counting
  - Sorting dictionaries by value

- `favorites.csv`
- `learning_csv.csv`
  - Sample dataset used during practice

## What I learned

- CSV is a dumb text format
- DictReader maps headers → values per row
- `sorted(dict)` returns a list of keys
- `key=counts.get` sorts keys using values
- Generators are Θ(1) per step, Θ(n) total
- Common pitfalls with `continue` and indexing

## Why this repo exists

This is not a project.
This is a **learning log** showing how my understanding evolved
through hands-on experimentation.
